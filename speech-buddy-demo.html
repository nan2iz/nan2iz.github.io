        If your cat is sneezing a lot, your veterinarian may initially suspect a cause based on a review of your cat's symptoms. ... In some cases, the vet may take a swab from the mouth, throat, eyes, or nose and send it to a lab to confirm an infection. Inhaled irritants or allergens are other common causes of sneezing in cats.
